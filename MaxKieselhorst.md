# Vulnerability Taxonomy CWE Homework  
## Chosen CWE: 125: Out-of-bounds Read  
### What is it?  
  CWE:125, or Out-of-bounds Read, is an easy to find weakness that occurs when data is read before the beginning of, or past the ending of the intended area. This can occur in the C, C++, or assembly programming languages, and can enable attackers to cause crashes, read sensitive information, consume resources, gain root access, and make changes to the affected system. The system expects there to be an implemented stop, but it might not exist in the Out-of-bounds Read portion, which can lead to the reading of excessive data, and in turn, causing a buffer overflow. After this occurs, the code can reference sources outside the buffer, which results in the answer being undefined.  
  
### Examples  
- Here are some example CVE's (common vulnerabilities and exposures)  
  1. CVE-2004-0421 found on 2004-05-05
  - In libpng (The Portable Network Graphics library) versions 1.0.15 and earlier, an attacker can cause a DOS attack/crash by using a modified PNG file that causes an out of bounds read whit it creates an error message.  
  2. CVE-2004-1940 found on 2005-05-10
  - The sipclient.cpp source file in KPhone version 4.0.1 and earlier makes it so attackers can cause a DOS attack/crash by using a stun packet whose attribute Length value that is large enough to cause an out of bounds read.
