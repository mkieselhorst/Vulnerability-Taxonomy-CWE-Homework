## Chosen CWE: 125: Out-of-bounds Read  
### What is it?  
CWE:125, or Out-of-bounds Read, is an easy to find weakness that occurs when data is read before the beginning of, or past the ending of the intended area. This can occur in the C, C++, or assembly programming languages, and can enable attackers to cause crashes, read sensitive information, consume resources, gain root access, and make changes to the affected system. The system expects there to be an implemented stop, but it might not exist in the Out-of-bounds Read portion, which can lead to the reading of excessive data, and in turn, causing a buffer overflow. After this occurs, the code can reference sources outside the buffer, which results in the answer being undefined.
